                    <h2>Understanding Fairness in AI</h2>
                    <p>
                        AI systems are trained on vast amounts of data, often leading to unintended biases. 
                        Addressing fairness in AI is crucial to ensure algorithms treat all users equally.
                        Techniques like bias auditing, diverse data representation, and fairness-aware algorithms help mitigate biases.
